    <h5 class="card-title">Work history</h5>
    <p class="card-text">I matriculated in 2017. I wished to break through the tech industry but I was placed in the HR department and I do not regret anything about that. I have worked in many different fields and we used different technologies such as Persal Systems, BAS and Logis. I have proven and seen a hard working and consistent on myself where I used to meet all the deadlines and complete my work on time. They wanted to keep me but since I knew that I belong to the tech world I went to further my studies at the University of the Western Cape (Library and Information Science 3rd year dropped out). I did not finish my Degree due to financial reasons however I was so fortunate to be accepted by Lifechoices coding academy. I am working hard to show appreciation to the organization. </p>

    <p class="card-text">Hi there! I am 23 years old and I am highly looking to grow my tech skills. I believe that I may fit the culture of your company based on my flexible personal characteristics  and values. I enjoy challenges but to be honest I am practicing being comfortable with uncomfortable situations. I love diversity and learning about other cultures is one of my interests. I am very curious and I like to explore how other people do things. Being curious about such things has helped me a lot in the coding industry. Learning from others is the key.
