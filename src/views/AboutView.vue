                        <p>Hi there! I am 23 years old and I am highly looking to grow my tech skills. I believe that I may fit the culture of your company based on my flexible personal characteristics  and values. I enjoy challenges but to be honest I am practicing being comfortable with uncomfortable situations. I love diversity and learning about other cultures is one of my interests. I am very curious and I like to explore how other people do things. Being curious about such things has helped me a lot in the coding industry. Learning from others is the key. </p>

                            My name is Philani Mxathule. I'm an aspiring fullstack Web Developer. I am very  passionate about technology and one day I would like to make change in the world using technology as a tool. I have the ability to use tech skills and build apps that would make a positive impact on people around the world. I upskill myself on a day to day basis with the hopes of becoming a better version of myself. I have a vision of becoming one of the most recognized web developer in the world no matter how difficult it is to get to that level.

                         <p class="card-text">I matriculated in 2017. I wished to break through the tech industry but I was placed in the HR department and I do not regret anything about that. I have worked in many different fields and we used different technologies such as Persal Systems, BAS and Logis. I have proven and seen a hard working and consistent on myself where I used to meet all the deadlines and complete my work on time. They wanted to keep me but since I knew that I belong to the tech world I went to further my studies at the University of the Western Cape (Library and Information Science 3rd year dropped out). I did not finish my Degree due to financial reasons however I was so fortunate to be accepted by Lifechoices coding academy. I am working hard to show appreciation to the organization. </p>
